The root cause of the "Error: spawn cmd ENOENT" error in this context was likely due to an issue in my system's PATH environment variable.  While Node.js and npm were installed, the Expo CLI might not have been able to locate the necessary executable files because they were not properly added to the system's PATH. 

**Solution:**
1. **Check PATH variable:** Verify that the directories containing Node.js, npm, and Expo CLI are correctly included in the system's PATH environment variable.  The specific paths will depend on your operating system.
2. **Restart system:** After modifying the PATH variable, restart your computer or terminal to ensure the changes take effect.
3. **Reinstall Node.js:** As a last resort if the above does not work, consider reinstalling Node.js to ensure the installation is complete and all necessary files are in the correct locations.   

By resolving the PATH environment variable issue, the Expo CLI was able to correctly locate the required executables, allowing the development server to start without errors.
