While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server failed to start with the following message:  "Error: spawn cmd ENOENT". I've checked my environment variables, ensured Node.js and npm are installed correctly, and restarted my computer, yet the issue persists.  My project's package.json and dependencies appear to be correctly configured. The error doesn't provide specific details about the cause, making it difficult to troubleshoot.
